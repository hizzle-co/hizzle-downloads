== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I see how many times each file has been downloaded? =

Yes, Noptin allows you to view how many times each file has been downloaded, as well as which users have downloaded the file. This information is available in the Noptin dashboard, where you can see a list of all your downloadable files and their download stats. You can also see which users have downloaded the files, and view their information and activity in your mailing list. This can be useful for tracking the popularity of your files and understanding which users are interested in them.

= Can I restrict downloads by user role or newsletter subscription status? =

Yes, Noptin allows you to restrict downloads by user role or newsletter subscription status. This means that you can choose which users are able to download your files, based on their user role on your website or their status as a newsletter subscriber. For example, you can make a file available only to users who are registered as members on your website, or only to users who have subscribed to your newsletter. This can be useful for creating exclusive content or offers for your users, and for encouraging people to sign up for your newsletter. You can set these restrictions for each of your downloadable files in the Noptin settings.
